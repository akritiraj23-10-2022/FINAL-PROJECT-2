			<H3 style="color:Purple">One of the most rewarding hobbies is keeping an Aquarium at home. </H3>
			<STRONG>Here's how we can make our own Aquarium:</STRONG>
			<P>
				1. Get a small glass container -- you can use a large glass jar, a goldfish  bowl, or buy a rectangular fish tank from a pet shop.(Once you know how to bring up  fish, you can graduate to larger and more elaborate Aquariums).

			</P>
			<P>2. Gravel, shells, coloured rocks, etc., are easy to get; wash these before you place them in the glass container.Remember not to put in too many things. </P>
			<P>3. If you are using tap water,it's good to allow it to remain open for a few hours,before putting the fish in. This will allow thw harmful gasses like chlorine to escape. Remember this also when you clean and refill the tank. </P>
			<P>4. Place your aquarium where there is a good supply of fresh air and light; but <STRONG>never</STRONG> in bright /direct  sunlight. </P>
			<P>5. There are many types of fish to choose from your local pet shop. Some we have found easy to look after are:  <STRONG><EM>kissing gurami, tangeline,angelfish, tetra, goldfish </EM></STRONG>and many others.  Don't forget to ask the dealer what and how often you should feed your fish. <STRONG>It is important not to overfeed them. </STRONG>Generally, it is best not to give more than they can finish in about 10 to 15 minutes. </P>
