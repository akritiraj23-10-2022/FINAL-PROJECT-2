One of the most rewarding hobbies is keeping an Aquarium at home.
Here's how we can make our own Aquarium:

1. Get a small glass container -- you can use a large glass jar, a goldfish
 bowl, or buy a rectangular fish tank from a pet shop.(Once you know 
how to bring up  fish, you can graduate to larger and more elaborate
Aquariums).

2. Gravel, shells, coloured rocks, etc., are easy to get; wash these before 
you place them in the glass container.Remember not to put in too many 
things.  

3. If you are using tap water,it's good to allow it to remain open for a few
hours,before putting the fish in. This will allow thw harmful gasses like 
chlorine to escape. Remember this also when you clean and refill the tank. 

4. Place your aquarium where there is a good supply of fresh air and light;
but never in bright /direct  sunlight.

5. There are many types of fish to choose from your local pet shop. Some 
we have found easy to look after are:  kissing gurami, tangeline,angelfish,
tetra, goldfish and many others.  Don't forget to ask the dealer 
what and how often you should feed your fish. It is important not 
to overfeed them. Generally, it is best not to give more than they 
can finish in about 10 to 15 minutes.
