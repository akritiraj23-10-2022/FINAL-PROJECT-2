Ladakh
Postcards from the Edge
Joolay, Joolay
The aircraft swooped into a valley perched on top of the world.

Beautifully stark, the corrugated landscape stretches out as far
as the eye can see. Snow capped mountains fold away from the verdant
valleys like so many wrinkles of a rough burlap sack. An invigorating
breeze whistles about your ears -- the only sound that disturbs
the ringing stillness.

Where do you find a wee place located way up in the clouds where
life has a celestial flow to it?

Disembark Leh, Ladakh. Ladakh is Little Tibet. But a miniature,
remote and free Tibet. India's largest district, situated on a
barren dry plateau, is part of the troubled state of Kashmir.
Boundaries on a map is where the connection ends. l.

Ladakh... A Paradise not lost. There are no cockroaches in this
Happy Valley. No beggars. Or graffiti. Cholesterol is not found
either. Can anything be better? In summer, life has the brisk
pace of the gently gurgling greeny Indus. And by winter life freezes
up just like the good river. The towering snow-speckled mountains
do not cast mean shadows but only thick, velvety ones that are
so reassuring. And the wispy clouds roll along in the brightest
blue sky this side of the Khyber Pass.

Farewell
