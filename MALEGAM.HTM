				<STRONG><span style="font-size:32pt;">W</span>hat about the mergers and acquisitions scenario in India?<BR /></STRONG>In India we are going to see a lot more of acquisitions than mergers of Indian units, as a fair amount of foreign investment is coming in the country. I see that in the next two years,  the rate of acquisitions by both the multinational and Indian companies will accelerate. Given a choice between a greenfield  project and an existing unit, an MNC will prefer to acquire an existing unit. <P>This is especially so in sectors like the consumer goods sector where companies rapidly want a market share. Any newcomer will have to invest substantially in advertising, in campaigning for the products, in building up a marketing base and creating  a market for itself.</P>
