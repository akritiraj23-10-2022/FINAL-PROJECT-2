The world has changed beyond our imaginings. Today,
the main item of currency is an intangible - and it's called information
Information, though, has to be current to be any good. Yesterday's
news is to wrap your sandwiches in, is what we mean.
And that is where we come in - by giving information that touch
of immediacy. Urgency. Currency.
What we, through a country-wide network of journalists, do is
keep an eye on happenings. In politics. Government. Industry.
Finance. Sports. Entertainment. The world, in fact.
No more waiting for the newspaper thrust under the door. Or for
the late evening newscast.
Here's where you learn what's happening, even as it happens.
Rediff, shall we say, is an ATM that deals with today's hottest
currency - information.
Rediff has been on the Web for just about 90 days. Yet it has
managed to log six million hits. Come, sample what's so compulsive
about it from a selection of pages bookmarked specially for you.
